# expense_tracker
I tried to build an app in flutter that can record the transaction we make in our daily life. It allows the user to track each of his/her everyday transactions, thay may be either income or expense. It allows the user to group the expenses as per their categories, but the functionality to add own categories is not built for now. Also, being a very basic app, it doesn't have any database. So it gets reset each time we restart the app. 

#note
Not a functional app to use for one's daily use, but just a simple app build by a beginner :)
But if you just wanna try the app, here you go

This app is inspired by the ui provided in dribble by Sagar Panchal < https://dribbble.com/SagarPanchal >
